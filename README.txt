This is my project for Kaggle.com's Spaceship Titanic data science challenge.
The main project is a jupyter notebook (Spaceship_Titanic.ipynb), which contains the exploration, cleaning, transforming, feature engineering, splitting, model training, testing, and prediction generation steps.
ReportExploration.html and ReportPrepping.html are ydata_profiling reports generated in the jupyter notebook, and contain insights for data exploration.
The raw data in the Data folder comes from Kaggle.com's Spaceship Titanic competition, and is available through a creative commons non-commercial share alike license.

As a side note, I used this project as my undergraduate capstone project as part of my B.S. Data Analytics degree from Western Governor's University.
As part of that project, I was required to create a project planning document that included a business case for the project. As a result, I had to modify the original starting story of Spaceship Titanic, to include future prediction and business needs.

I hope you find the jupyter notebook informative and intuitive! If you're attempting the competition, good luck on your rescue/prediction efforts!
